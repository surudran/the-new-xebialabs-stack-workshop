# Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to show you how XL Deploy and XL Release, as well as the XL CLI, can be used for cloud and container use cases.

The command in this workshop are macOS/Linux commands. If you run Windows, use `xlw.bat` instaed of `./xlw`.

## Before you start
* Make sure Docker is running
* Make sure Kubernetes is running for your Docker platform

### For macOS
* [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [Enable its Kubernetes mode](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)
* Make sure your Docker environment variables and Kubernetes configuration are set correctly. If you've just installed Docker for Desktop, you should be good.

### For Windows
* [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [Enable its Kubernetes mode](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#kubernetes)
* Make sure your Docker environment variables and Kubernetes configuration are set correctly. If you've just installed Docker for Desktop, you should be good.


# Exercise 1: Run the XL CLI

XL Deploy and XL Release have a user interface and a command line interface. Let's start by experimenting with the XL CLI.

You don't need to install it. This repository contains a wrapper that will automatically download and run it.

Go to the `scratch` directory in this repository and check which version of the XL CLI binary you're running:

```plain
$ cd scratch
$ ./xlw version
```

The output should look something like this:

```plain
CLI version:             9.0.0-alpha.1
Git version:             8.7.0-alpha.9-3-g6da31a0
API version XL Deploy:   xl-deploy/v1
API version XL Release:  xl-release/v1
Git commit:              6da31a072cd5ce6bfc412d99dfe6138e005d2611
Build date:              2019-05-06T11:17:39.090Z
GO version:              go1.11
OS/Arch:                 darwin/amd64
```

# Exercise 2: Start XL Deploy and XL Release

XL Deploy and XL Release are delivered as Docker images. To start them, we'll need a Docker Compose file.

Luckily the XL CLI's "blueprint" functionality can create those for us. Start the blueprint instantiation process.

```plain
$ ./xlw blueprint
```

You should see a list that looks like this:

```plain
? Choose a blueprint:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> aws/datalake
  aws/microservice-ecommerce
  aws/monolith
  aws/monolith-terraform
  azure/basic-aks-cluster
  devsecops/security-scanning
  docker/application
```

Scroll down to `xl-devops-platform` and press the Enter key and respond to the prompts by pressing the Enter key another 8 times:

```plain
? Do you want to install XL Deploy? Yes
? Host port for XL Deploy: 4516
? Do you want to install XL Release? Yes
? Host port for XL Release: 5516
? Do you want to use JetPack or XL Enterprise: JetPack
? Select the version of XL you want to use: 8.6.1
? Do you want to be able to deploy to your local Docker instance? Yes
? Confirm to generate blueprint files? Yes
```

Have a look at the files that were generated by this blueprint:

* `docker/docker-compose.yml` is the Docker Compose that we'll want to run
* `docker/docker/docker-compose.yml` is the XL YAML file that describes some initial setup for XL Release
* `xebialabs/config.yaml` is a configuration file for the XL CLI that makes it refer to the files just generated.
* and, most importantly, `xebialabs/USAGE-docker-compose.md` describes how to use these files.

Follow the instructions in the latter file to start XL Deploy and XL Release.

# Exercise 3: Go to the user interface

Open a browser and go to the following URL for XL Deploy:

> http://localhost:4516

The default username and password combination is `admin`/`admin`.

Open another tab and go to the following URL for XL Release:

> http://localhost:5516

Again, the default username and password combination is `admin`/`admin`.

If you want a different admin password, change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file before starting it for the first time. Leave it out for a randomly generated password. You'll have to check the container logs to see what passwords have been selected.
